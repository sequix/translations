You won't find those Indians, 'cause they ain't here

或者 如果你想下水 你可能会找到他们

他们确实应该这样做 这是事实 坦普尔先生

00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,107
他们在狱外的时间越长 他们的处境就越艰难
The longer they stay at large, the tougher it'll be on them

喝太多酒了 仅此而已 坦普尔先生

Look here! if you people can't behave yourselves, you gotta leave

150
00:10:47,577 --> 00:10:50,068
你得知道 他是个酒鬼
I'll let you in on something. She's a lush

151
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:53,533
几杯之后 她会看到幻觉
After she bends the elbow a few times, she sees things

152
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,247
老鼠 蟑螂 蛇 蝙蝠之类的
Rats, roaches, snakes, bats, you know

153
00:10:56,502 --> 00:10:59,836
给她一巴掌是唯一让她恢复的方法
A sock in the kisser is the only thing that'll bring her out of it

154
00:11:01,758 --> 00:11:03,584
你的房间准备好了 少校
Your room's ready, major

155
00:11:06,637 --> 00:11:08,262
他们来这里多久了
How long have they been here

156
00:11:08,514 --> 00:11:10,673
刚才那人克里和那个女人最先来的
That one, Curly, and the woman showed up first

157
00:11:10,933 --> 00:11:15,010
爸爸坦普尔说我们关门了 但他要包场一周
Dad Temple told them we were closed but he offered to rent the whole hotel for a week

158
00:11:15,271 --> 00:11:17,940
钱太多了 爸爸无法拒绝
It was so much money, Dad couldn't afford to turn it down

159
00:11:18,191 --> 00:11:20,895
布朗先生和其他人 四天前乘坐那艘大船到的
Mr.Brown and the others arrived in that big boat four days ago

160
00:11:21,152 --> 00:11:22,350

161
00:11:22,612 --> 00:11:25,529

他长什么样
What's he like

163
00:11:27,158 --> 00:11:28,866
他是个女性杀手 或者他自己这么觉得
He's a lady-killer, or thinks so

164
00:11:29,118 --> 00:11:32,203
我猜是富人 他一动手指 其他人就跳了起来
Rich, I guess. The others jump when he lifts a finger

165
00:11:32,455 --> 00:11:34,412
在这种高温下 他们的出现不合时宜
Out of season in this heat

166
00:11:34,665 --> 00:11:37,702
为什么他们决定在基・拉戈岛住下来

167
00:11:38,294 --> 00:11:40,785

他从来不知道是什么击中了他
He never knew what hit him

173
00:11:53,184 --> 00:11:55,342
我担心他可能会受苦
I was afraid he might have suffered

174
00:11:57,605 --> 00:12:00,179
准备好后到爸爸的房间来 少校
Come down to Dad's room when you're ready, Major

175
00:12:32,098 --> 00:12:33,592
对不起
Excuse me

176
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,392
在这过夜
Staying the night, huh

177
00:12:35,643 --> 00:12:36,924
我是克里・霍夫
I'm Curly Hoff

178
00:12:37,186 --> 00:12:40,472
我听说你在意大利和坦普尔老人的儿子在一起
I heard how you were with old man Temple's son in ltaly

179
00:12:40,732 --> 00:12:41,977
那孩子中弹了 是吧
The kid got it, huh

180
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:43,692
太糟了
Too bad

181
00:12:43,943 --> 00:12:46,648
希望你没有生气 我们那样对待你 
I hope you didn't take offense the way we handled you downstairs

182
00:12:46,904 --> 00:12:49,193
图茨和我当时状态不好
You caught Toots and me at a bad time

183
00:12:49,407 --> 00:12:51,446
我们准备咬掉任何人的头
We were ready to bite anybody's head off

184
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:53,948
尤其是某个金发的
Especially a certain blond's

185
00:12:54,203 --> 00:12:57,074
我们五人来到这钓深海鱼
Five of us come down here for the deep-sea fishing

186
00:12:57,331 --> 00:12:58,874
一路从密尔沃基出发
All the way from Milwaukee

187
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:03,336
一年多来 我们一直计划来这里大展拳脚
More than a year, we'd been planning to come down here and fish our brains out

188
00:13:03,588 --> 00:13:06,126
然后发生什么了？一个人带来了一个金发女郎
So what happens? One guy brings a blond

189
00:13:06,382 --> 00:13:08,707
还是在我们所有人都发誓不带女人之后
And after we all swore up and down, no dames

190
00:13:08,968 --> 00:13:10,842
但他必须带她来 这家伙
But he's gotta bring her, this guy

191
00:13:11,095 --> 00:13:14,595
她不是喝醉哭闹 就是宿醉吵架
If she isn't drunk and crying, she's got a hangover and arguing

192
00:13:14,849 --> 00:13:17,554
一分钟前她对你很生气 不跟你说话
One minute she gets sore at you and won't talk

193
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,681
下一分钟她又要为你表演 当着他男人的面 
Next she's making a play for you right in front of the guy

194
00:13:20,938 --> 00:13:23,264
然后他对我们生气 注意 不是对她
And he gets sore at us, mind you, not her

195
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:26,686
一切都被破坏了 包括我们的脾气
Everything's spoiled, including our dispositions

196
00:13:26,944 --> 00:13:29,566
我们花了这么多钱 为了什么
It's cost us all this dough, and for what

197
00:13:29,822 --> 00:13:31,732
世界上最糟糕的时期
The world's worst time

198
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:34,316
我问你 你能怪我们粗鲁吗
I ask you, can you blame us for getting rude

199
00:13:34,577 --> 00:13:36,902
- 我不怪你 - 喝一杯怎么样

205
00:13:46,047 --> 00:13:48,086

飓风要来了
Hurricane's on its way

207
00:13:50,093 --> 00:13:52,418
明白我的意思了吗？还要来飓风
See what I mean? Hurricanes yet

208
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:54,552
爸爸在这里 少校
Dad's in here, major

210
00:14:01,437 --> 00:14:04,355
战争结束了 坦普尔先生 我不再是少校了
The war's over, Mr.Temple. I'm not a major anymore

211
00:14:04,607 --> 00:14:12,154
我知道那些去打仗的人不喜欢谈论战争 我也不喜欢强加给你
I know the men that went don't like talking about the war and I don't like imposing on you

212
00:14:12,615 --> 00:14:17,449
但是军队的这封信是我们掌握的唯一事实
But this letter here from the War Department is the only facts we have

213
00:14:17,704 --> 00:14:21,238
它让我们对一些事情一无所知
And it leaves us in the dark about a few things

214
00:14:21,499 --> 00:14:23,326
我会告诉你我所知道的一切 坦普尔先生
I'll tell you everything I know, Mr.Temple

215
00:14:23,584 --> 00:14:25,209
你愿意吗 弗兰克？你会吗
Will you, Frank? Will you

216
00:14:25,461 --> 00:14:26,872
我将不胜感激
I'd be most grateful

217
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,585
- 我应该从哪里开始？- 都可以
- Where shall I start? - Anywhere

218
00:14:30,717 --> 00:14:33,124
他从头到尾都是一名好士兵
He was a good soldier from start to finish

219
00:14:33,386 --> 00:14:36,387
你会感到自豪 就像他团里的每个人一样
You'd have been proud like every man in his regiment was

220
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,431
- 是吗 弗兰克？- 有充分的理由
- Were they, Frank? - With good reason

221
00:14:40,101 --> 00:14:42,259
这不仅仅是履行职责的问题
It wasn't just a matter of doing his duty

222
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,762
他一直想做更多
He was always looking for a way to do more

223
00:14:45,023 --> 00:14:46,730
也真的做了更多
And finding it

224
00:14:46,983 --> 00:14:48,975
乔治是天生的英雄
George was a born hero

225
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:52,280
他无法想象自己的死亡 只害怕耻辱
He couldn't imagine his death. Only dishonor

226
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,238
是的 当然是的
No, of course not

227
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,400
他能坚持到卡西诺真是个奇迹
It's a wonder he lasted till Cassino

228
00:14:56,951 --> 00:15:00,819
当你像乔治那样相信时 死亡就不是很重要了
When you believe like George believed, dying isn't very important

229
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:09,121
有一次在圣・彼得城外 乔治和其他几人建立了一个观察哨
Once, outside San Pietro, George and a couple others established an forward observation post

230
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:11,876
他们被直接击中 一些人被杀
They got a direct hit, and the others were killed

231
00:15:12,133 --> 00:15:13,413
岗哨留给了乔治
That left it up to George

232
00:15:13,634 --> 00:15:17,502
三天三夜他一直保持清醒 指挥我们开火
Three days and three nights he stayed awake directing our fire

233
00:15:18,181 --> 00:15:21,300
大部分时间 我都在电话的另一端
Most of that time, I was on the other end of the line

234
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:24,595
为了让自己保持清醒 他对着电话说话
To keep himself awake, he talked into the phone

235
00:15:24,979 --> 00:15:27,304
一直在谈论
Talked and talked

236
00:15:27,732 --> 00:15:29,771
他的大部分谈话都是关于你们两个的
Most of his talk was about you two

237
00:15:30,568 --> 00:15:33,059
你会惊讶于我对你们俩的了解如此之多
You'd be surprised how much I know about you both

238
00:15:33,571 --> 00:15:36,821
例如 在你的结婚戒指内有一个铭文
For instance, inside your wedding ring there's an inscription

239
00:15:37,075 --> 00:15:38,154
永远
Evermore

240
00:15:38,993 --> 00:15:40,191
没错
That's right

241
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,699
还有你 坦普尔先生
And you, Mr.Temple

242
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:45,699
你还记得告诉乔治上唇的空洞是什么吗
Do you remember telling George what this hollow is above the upper lip

243
00:15:46,417 --> 00:15:50,333
在他出生之前 你说他知道生与死的所有秘密
Before he was born, you said he knew all the secrets of life and death

244
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,092
然后在他出生时 一位天使来把他的手指放在这里
And then at his birth, an angel came and put his finger right here

245
00:15:55,301 --> 00:15:56,546
封住了他的嘴唇
And sealed his lips

246
00:15:58,304 --> 00:16:00,048
我记得
I remember that

247
00:16:01,349 --> 00:16:06,051
当我给他讲那个童话故事时 他不过7岁
He couldn't have been more than 7 years old when I told him that fairy story

248
00:16:07,021 --> 00:16:08,646
他被埋葬的地方怎么样
What's it like where he's buried

249
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:12,854
刚好穿过斜坡
Just crosses on a slope

250
00:16:13,653 --> 00:16:16,025
高处是教堂的遗迹
High up, there's what's left of a church

251
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,736
你可以从乔治所在的地方看到一条河
You can see a river from where George is

252
00:16:20,076 --> 00:16:22,697
我想去那个地方看看
I'd like to pay a visit to that place

253
00:16:23,454 --> 00:16:25,411
是的 我愿意
Yep, I would

254
00:16:25,873 --> 00:16:29,159
诺拉 也许我们会这样做
Nora, maybe we'll do just that

255
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:33,287
去意大利看看乔治埋葬的地方
Go to ltaly and see where George is buried

256
00:16:34,215 --> 00:16:37,002
它属于我们 不是吗？那块地

257

我非常感谢你 弗兰克

陆地上的生活对我来说太复杂了
Life on land's become too complicated for my taste

265
00:17:36,486 --> 00:17:38,028
战前你做什么工作

我是一家报纸的发行经理

很稳
Plenty heavy

276

那么我们最好加倍这些绳索
Then we'd just better double up on these bowlines

277

你是从哪里学的船

278

你觉得那艘船怎么样

乔治告诉你了吗？我是在舞会上认识他的

314
00:21:33,848 --> 00:21:35,971
他很孤独 他需要陪伴

我认识很多人 但我也很孤独

在乔治之前 我的生活没有多大意义
Before George, my life hadn't made much sense

我从来没有可以称得上家的地方 而且我不喜欢我拥有的东西
I never had much of a home, and I didn't like what I had

319

乔治给了我根

在我拿油灯的时候关上窗户

They're snooping around looking for these two boys, and here they are

是的 没错

00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,586
在美国生活了30年 他们称我为不被需要的外国人
After living in the U.S.A. for more than 30 years they called me an undesirable alien

448
00:30:26,255 --> 00:30:27,963
我 约翰尼·罗科
Me, Johnny Rocco

449
00:30:28,508 --> 00:30:31,177
就像我是一个肮脏的康米什么的

这不是真的 你是在做梦

醒来吧 老爹 你在打鼾
Wake up pop you're snoring

你是对的
You're right

455

你不应该被驱逐出境
You shouldn't have been deported

456
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,314
你早该被消灭了
You should've been exterminated

罗科 我为坦普尔先生道歉 他不知道自己在说什么
Rocco I apologize for Mr.Temple. He doesn't know what he's talking about

458
00:30:56,953 --> 00:30:59,526
罗科不仅仅是一位国王 他是一位皇帝
Rocco was more than a king. He was an emperor

他统治啤酒、老虎机、数字球拍和其他被禁止的产业
His rule extended over beer, slot machines, the numbers racket and other forbidden enterprises

460
00:31:05,336 --> 00:31:06,914
他是那些行当的大师
He was a master of the fix

461
00:31:07,296 --> 00:31:10,582
无法被腐化的人 他会恐吓或谋杀
Whom he couldn't corrupt, he terrified or murdered

462
00:31:10,842 --> 00:31:13,961
你这个肮脏的东西！你这个城市的污物
You filth! You city filth

463
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:17,470
坦普尔先生 你真是太过时了
Mr.Temple, you're hopelessly old-fashioned

464
00:31:17,682 --> 00:31:23,968
当时美国认为没有约翰尼·罗科斯也能过得去
Your ideas date back years to the time when America thought it could get along without the Johnny Roccos

465
00:31:24,188 --> 00:31:26,644
欢迎回来 罗科先生 一切都是误会
Welcome back, Mr.Rocco. It was all a mistake

美国对它对你们的所作所为感到抱歉

当然 我就是这么伟大
Sure, I was all of those things

00:31:42,999 --> 00:31:44,113
甚至更加伟大
And more

472
00:31:44,709 --> 00:31:46,951
当罗科讲话时 所有人都闭嘴倾听
When Rocco talked, everybody shut up and listened

473
00:31:47,211 --> 00:31:49,003
罗科说去做 有人就去做
What Rocco said, went

474
00:31:49,213 --> 00:31:51,171
没有人像罗科一样伟大
Nobody was as big as Rocco

475
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:54,291
它会再次伟大 只会更伟大
It'll be like that again, only more so

476
00:31:54,635 --> 00:31:58,087
有一天我会再次伟大 你们会看到我的壮举
I'll be back up there one day. Then you'll really see something

477
00:31:58,348 --> 00:32:05,642
如果有一天 你们这些人可以毫无恐惧的走在街上...
If the time ever comes when your kind can walk a city street in daylight with nothing to fear from the people...

现在就是那天 坦普尔先生 就是现在
The time has come, Mr.Temple. It's here

00:32:10,985 --> 00:32:12,610
你了解我的一切
You know all about me

00:32:13,654 --> 00:32:15,647
那么 聪明的家伙 你又怎样
Now, what's with you, wise guy

481
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,149

你参加了战争 不是吗
In the war, weren't you

483
00:32:21,245 --> 00:32:23,653
- 获得任何勋章？- 有一些

484
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,866
- 很勇敢？- 不是特别地

486

你在说什么？弗兰克
What are you saying? Frank

00:32:32,548 --> 00:32:34,671
我相信一些话
I believed some words

488
00:32:34,926 --> 00:32:36,503
话？什么话
Words? What words

489
00:32:36,761 --> 00:32:38,588
好吧 是这样的
Well, they went like this

490
00:32:38,846 --> 00:32:42,630
人类的努力和牺牲
But we aren't making all this sacrifice of human effort and lives

491
00:32:42,892 --> 00:32:47,269
并没有换回世界大战前的世界
to return to the kind of a world we had after the last world war

492
00:32:56,656 --> 00:33:00,239
我们正在为清除世界上古老的邪恶而战
We're fighting to cleanse the world of ancient evils

493
00:33:00,493 --> 00:33:01,904

Ancient ills

494
00:33:03,705 --> 00:33:04,736

我记得那些话
I remember those words

496

那就是我们两个人
That makes two of us

497
00:33:10,211 --> 00:33:13,461
我们一劳永逸地摆脱了你们
We rid ourselves of your kind once and for all

498
00:33:13,715 --> 00:33:15,506
你不会回来了
You ain't coming back

499
00:33:15,758 --> 00:33:17,881
谁能阻止我 老人
Who's gonna stop me, old man

500
00:33:18,177 --> 00:33:20,004
如果我不是瘸子...
If I wasn't a cripple...

501
00:33:20,263 --> 00:33:22,836
那你就不会这样乱叫了 对吧 老爹

太危险了 船会撞到礁石

在大厅里 我遇到了这两个人
Down the lobby, I ran up against these two

554
00:36:14,228 --> 00:36:17,597
我觉得他们不对 所以我问了他们几个问题
They didn't look right to me, so I asked them a few questions

555
00:36:17,857 --> 00:36:20,430
从他们回答的方式来看 我知道有些不对劲
By the way they answered, I knew there was something fishy

556
00:36:20,693 --> 00:36:24,987
所以我给本·韦德警官打了个电话 但我眼前就黑了
So I put in a call to Ben Wade, but the lights went out on me

557
00:36:27,033 --> 00:36:28,907

我要说一件事 你肯定能接受
I'll say one thing, you sure can take it

所以我没法逃掉 是吧
So I won't get away with it, huh

对于任何大城市的警察来说 我都难以应付
I was too much for any big-city police force to handle

583
00:37:55,455 --> 00:37:57,494
他们尝试过 但他们做不到
They tried, but they couldn't

584
00:37:58,416 --> 00:38:01,085
美国政府指责我

我造就了他们 就像裁缝做衣服一样

他只想保住自己肮脏的脖子

你知道你想要什么吗
Do you know what you want

734
00:46:00,231 --> 00:46:03,066
是的 我曾经有过希望 但我放弃了

好的 士兵 你可以让你的希望成真

多一个罗科 少一个罗科 不值得为之送命
One Rocco more or less isn't worth dying for

754
00:47:12,053 --> 00:47:13,333

00:47:13,596 --> 00:47:15,174
不 恐怕你会开枪
No, I'm afraid you'd use it

有一个老头儿 没一个老头儿 不值得为之送命
One old man more or less isn't worth dying for

757
00:47:20,061 --> 00:47:21,520

00:47:44,085 --> 00:47:46,327
现在让你和我来玩这个游戏吧
Let's you and me play that game now

767
00:47:47,255 --> 00:47:49,924
你可以阻止我走出那扇门

768
00:47:50,174 --> 00:47:52,381
但你必须先死
But you gotta die first

769
00:47:53,094 --> 00:47:55,502
如果他向我开枪 你明白我会开枪
If he shoots me, you still get it

770
00:47:56,431 --> 00:47:57,462
别挡我的路
Get out of my way

00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:05,438
离开那扇门
Get away from that door

772
00:48:31,466 --> 00:48:33,375
枪没有上膛
The gun wasn't loaded

773
00:48:35,219 --> 00:48:37,295
他没有机会
He didn't have a chance

774
00:48:38,598 --> 00:48:39,760
杀人犯
Murderer

775
00:48:40,892 --> 00:48:42,635
不得不这样做 老人
Had to do it, old man

776
00:48:43,353 --> 00:48:45,725
否则他会走出那扇门然后离开
Or he would've been out that door and gone

777
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:47,095
他现在走了
He's gone now

778
00:48:48,441 --> 00:48:51,644
没错 小姐 枪没有上膛
That's right, sister. The gun wasn't loaded

779
00:48:51,903 --> 00:48:53,314
但我们的英雄并不知道
But our hero didn't know it

780
00:49:03,831 --> 00:49:06,666
你知道枪是空的 不是吗 孩子
You knew the gun was empty, didn't you, son

781
00:49:06,918 --> 00:49:08,495
你可以通过重量来判断
You could tell by the weight

782
00:49:08,753 --> 00:49:10,033
不 先生 我不知道
No, sir. I didn't know

783
00:49:10,296 --> 00:49:11,838
他只是没那胆子
He just didn't have the nerve

784
00:49:12,131 --> 00:49:13,163
让我们面对现实吧
Let's face it

785
00:49:13,424 --> 00:49:14,800
伙计 你很聪明
You were smart, fella

786
00:49:15,051 --> 00:49:17,090
发生在他身上的事也会发生在你身上
What happened to him would've happened to you

787
00:49:17,345 --> 00:49:20,381
做一个活着的懦夫比做一个死去的英雄要好
It's better to be a live coward than a dead hero

788
00:49:21,724 --> 00:49:23,100
抱歉
Excuse me

789
00:49:24,268 --> 00:49:26,391
你并不害怕 我们都知道

哦 不 我很害怕
Oh, yes, I was afraid

791
00:49:28,439 --> 00:49:30,147
但这不是我不开枪的原因
But that's not why I didn't shoot

792
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,021
我为什么要在乎约翰尼·罗科的生死
What do I care whether Johnny Rocco lives or dies

793
00:49:33,277 --> 00:49:35,353
我只关心我自己！我 我的生死
I only care about me! Me and mine

794
00:49:35,905 --> 00:49:39,072
罗科想回到美国 让他去吧！让他当总统
Rocco wants to come back to America, let him! Let him be President

795
00:49:39,325 --> 00:49:41,484
除了我自己 我不为任何人而战
I fight nobody's battles but my own

796
00:49:41,703 --> 00:49:43,576
我不明白你的意思 弗兰克
I can't see it your way, Frank

797
00:49:44,288 --> 00:49:45,913
索耶也不明白
Sawyer didn't either

798
00:49:46,165 --> 00:49:47,197
他是个傻瓜
He was a fool

799
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:50,835
我为了让世界摆脱约翰尼·罗科而死？
Me, die to rid the world of a Johnny Rocco?

800
00:49:51,754 --> 00:49:52,584
不了 谢谢
No, thanks

801
00:49:53,047 --> 00:49:55,289

...我也想死
...I'd want to be dead too

803
00:50:00,054 --> 00:50:01,217
的确
It's true

804
00:50:01,889 --> 00:50:03,170
你是个胆小鬼
You are a coward

805
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:05,840
你现在说的只是为了面子
What you're saying now is only to save your corward's face

806
00:50:06,352 --> 00:50:07,383
别说了 诺拉
Now, Nora

807
00:50:07,729 --> 00:50:09,638
也许弗兰克是对的
maybe Frank's right

808
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:12,143
也许他是对的
Maybe he's right

809
00:51:07,413 --> 00:51:10,331
有什么想法 齐吉？你为什么还不来
What's the idea, Ziggy? Why ain't you started yet

810
00:51:10,833 --> 00:51:12,114
那又怎样
So what

811
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,625
怎么了 你们？我没有冒险吗
What's the matter, you guys? Didn't I take chances

812
00:51:16,881 --> 00:51:20,546
我从古巴逃跑 冒着我的性命 我的船和货物的风险
I make the run from Cuba, risk my neck, my boat and the shipment

813
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,420
而你却不愿从雨中出来
and you won't come out in the rain

814
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:26,344
听我说 要么你今晚出现 要么交易取消
Listen to me. Either you show tonight or the deal is off

815
00:51:26,599 --> 00:51:30,134
我知道有十几个人愿意为这批货不惜一切代价
I know a dozen guys who'd break their necks to get this shipment

816
00:51:30,395 --> 00:51:32,268
听着 我的手表说
Look, my watch says. .

817
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:33,352
现在是8点

00:51:33,564 --> 00:51:36,815
我给你两个小时 10点你还没到 交易就取消
I give you two hours. You ain't here by 10, the deal is off

819
00:51:37,318 --> 00:51:38,777

Didn't I say no drinking

822
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,908

00:53:12,955 --> 00:53:14,070
等等
Wait

827
00:53:14,582 --> 00:53:16,622
有人在那吗
Is that someone calling

828
00:53:16,918 --> 00:53:19,290
印第安人站在门口 我把他们送走了
Indians were at the door. I sent them away

829
00:53:19,545 --> 00:53:20,956
你做得不对
You'd no right

830
00:53:28,388 --> 00:53:29,218

楼上的窗户必须关上 要么屋顶可能会被吹翻
The upstairs shutters gotta be closed, or the roof might come off

832
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:34,923
关上窗户
Go close them

833
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:49,859
我无法忍受一位女酒鬼
One thing I can't stand is a dame that's drunk

834
00:53:50,618 --> 00:53:53,074
她们让我反胃
What I mean, they turn my stomach

835
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:56,284
对她们自己或其他任何人都没有好处
No good to themselves or anybody else

836
00:53:58,793 --> 00:54:00,168
她在发抖了 看
She got the shakes, see

837
00:54:00,753 --> 00:54:03,920
所以她喝了一杯来不再发抖 然后她又喝一杯
So she has a drink to get rid of them. Then she has another

838
00:54:04,173 --> 00:54:06,166
最后 她就成酒鬼了
First thing you know, she's stinko again

839
00:54:06,426 --> 00:54:08,418
你给了我第一杯酒
You gave me my first drink

840
00:54:08,678 --> 00:54:10,635
哦 所以现在都是我的错了
Oh, so it's all my fault now

841
00:54:11,222 --> 00:54:15,006
每个人都会喝第一杯酒 但不是所有人都是酒鬼
Everybody has their first drink, but everybody ain't a lush

842
00:54:15,268 --> 00:54:18,269
如果我知道你会这样 我就不会来这里了
If I'd known you'd act this way, I wouldn't have come here

843
00:54:18,521 --> 00:54:21,605
如果我知道你是个酒鬼 就不会请你来了
If I'd known what you're like, you wouldn't have been asked

844
00:54:23,484 --> 00:54:25,856
自从我见到她已经8年了
Eight years since I seen her

845
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:32,323
你不会觉得这是同一位女士
You wouldn't know it's the same dame

846
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:36,573
你肯定一点都没有改变
You certainly haven't changed one bit

847
00:54:37,290 --> 00:54:38,618
什么意思
Meaning what

848
00:54:39,292 --> 00:54:40,490
没什么意思
Nothing

849
00:54:41,502 --> 00:54:43,542
哎呀 你太刻薄了
Gee, you're as mean as can be

850
00:54:44,756 --> 00:54:47,757
刻薄就刻薄 这让我想起了什么
Mean as can be. Now what does that remind me of

851
00:54:48,009 --> 00:54:48,958
你不记得了吗
Don't you remember

852
00:54:49,218 --> 00:54:51,341
那是在一首歌里 她曾经唱过
That was in a song. She used to sing it

853
00:54:51,596 --> 00:54:53,339
是的 没错
Yeah, that's right

854
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:56,463
我给了她第一次机会 让她成为一名歌手
I gave her her first chance, made her a singer

855
00:54:56,726 --> 00:55:00,095
对了 为什么你不是一个歌星而不是一个酒鬼
Mention that. Why ain't you a singing star instead of a lush

856
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:02,889
约翰尼 我说你刻薄不代表什么
Johnny, I didn't mean anything

857
00:55:03,149 --> 00:55:05,474
是的 她本可以拥有未来
Yeah, she could've had a future

858
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:07,015
她拥有一切
She had everything

859
00:55:07,236 --> 00:55:08,066
嗓音

860
00:55:08,279 --> 00:55:09,310

教养
Plenty of class

00:55:11,532 --> 00:55:13,490
我当时很生气
I was the rage

863
00:55:14,118 --> 00:55:15,197
哎呀 亲爱的
Gee, honey

864
00:55:17,955 --> 00:55:19,829
现在 盖伊 听着
Now, look, Gaye. .

865
00:55:21,084 --> 00:55:23,409
你为什么不给我们唱唱你的老歌呢
why don't you give us your old song

866
00:55:25,546 --> 00:55:27,539

You mean, right now

867
00:55:30,468 --> 00:55:33,173
- 我不能 - 你当然可以
- I can't. - Sure you can

868
00:55:33,429 --> 00:55:34,888
请不要逼我
Please don't make me

869
00:55:35,431 --> 00:55:37,757
我不会强迫你做任何事情
I won't make you do anything

870
00:55:39,352 --> 00:55:41,261
我有一个建议给你
I got a proposition for you

871
00:55:41,521 --> 00:55:43,229
唱首歌 你可以喝一杯
Sing a song, you can have a drink

没有任何伴奏
Without any accompaniment

876
00:55:56,953 --> 00:55:59,444
你到底想不想喝一杯
Now, look, do you want a drink or don't you

877
00:56:04,377 --> 00:56:05,207
好吧

只是一些口红 仅此而已
Just some lipstick, that's all

884

没有灯光 只有一个聚光灯

00:56:31,738 --> 00:56:35,735
我不会有任何入场仪式 他们会在黑暗中演奏前奏
I wouldn't have any entrance. They'd play the intro in the dark

886
00:56:35,992 --> 00:56:37,819
然后舞台一处升起
and a spot would come on

887
00:56:38,077 --> 00:56:39,156
我会在那里

如果甜蜜的男人从我身边经过

有了他的担忧 让我的麻烦加倍

905
00:58:02,286 --> 00:58:03,994

我在问你问题！你听到了吗
I asked you a question! Did you hear me

924
01:00:36,524 --> 01:00:40,474
我们经历过的最严重的暴风雨发生在35年

925
01:00:40,695 --> 01:00:45,773
风掀起一个大浪打到基・马特库姆贝

抱歉我在楼上说的话

当然
Of course

933
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,366
他可能杀了你 但就算如此 你不得不帮助她
He might've killed you, but that makes no difference, you had to help her

934
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:33,704
你的脑袋认为是这样 但你的整个生命却是另一个样子
Your head said one way, but your whole life said another

935
01:01:33,915 --> 01:01:37,450
其他事情 也许是真的 也许这是一个腐烂的世界
The other things, maybe they're true. Maybe it is a rotten world

936
01:01:37,710 --> 01:01:40,462
但如果有人愿意为其战斗 信仰就不会完结

你是
But you are

939
01:01:45,385 --> 01:01:47,792
你可能不想成为 但你情不自禁
You may not want to be, but you can't help yourself

940
01:01:48,054 --> 01:01:49,678
你的一生都在与你的思想作对
Your whole life's against you

941
01:01:49,889 --> 01:01:52,012
你对我的生活了解多少

943

他最后一封信的大部分内容都是关于你和他的电话
Most of his last letter was all about you and him on the phone

945
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:06,402

946
01:02:56,247 --> 01:02:57,196

947
01:02:57,874 --> 01:02:58,704
没什么
Nothing

948
01:03:02,628 --> 01:03:03,827
为什么大家都这么安静
Why's everybody so quiet

949
01:03:05,298 --> 01:03:06,757
说话啊 你为什么不说话
Talk, why don't you

950
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:10,625
克里 说点什么
Curly, say something

951
01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:13,971
- 你想让我说什么？- 任何事情 随便说点
- What do you want me to say? - Anything, just so it's talk

952
01:03:14,223 --> 01:03:17,177
- 来吧！- 我在努力思考
- Go ahead! - I'm trying to think

953
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:21,264
我跟你打赌两三年 我们会恢复禁酒令
I bet you two or three years, we get Prohibition back

954
01:03:22,106 --> 01:03:24,182
这次我们让禁酒令持续下去
This time we make it stick

955
01:03:25,151 --> 01:03:27,903
我跟你打赌两三年 禁酒令又回来了
I bet you two or three years, Prohibition comes back

956
01:03:28,154 --> 01:03:29,981
绝对 是的
Absolutely, yeah

957
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:34,654
问题是 以前有太多人想成为头号人物
The trouble was, before, too many guys wanted to be top dog

958
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:37,369
这就是问题所在
That was the trouble

959
01:03:38,039 --> 01:03:40,078
一群暴徒开始屠杀另一群暴徒
One mob gets to massacring another

960
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:42,658
报纸大肆宣传 大肆宣传 看到了吗
The papers play it up big. Big, see

961
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:44,995
- 那么会发生什么？- 所以呢
- So what happens? - So what

962
01:03:45,338 --> 01:03:47,580
报纸和公众大肆宣传
The papers play it up big, and the public

963
01:03:47,924 --> 01:03:50,249
然后大家明白了禁酒令不好
gets the idea that Prohibition's no good

964
01:03:51,177 --> 01:03:53,051
如果他们能摆脱它
That if they can get rid of it

965
01:03:53,304 --> 01:03:55,511
- 摆脱禁酒令 我的意思是 - 我不相信
- Prohibition, I mean... - I don't believe it

966
01:03:55,765 --> 01:03:58,600
八百人被冲入大海 你是个骗子
Eight hundred guys washed out to sea. You're a liar

967
01:03:58,851 --> 01:04:00,678
如果真发生了那种事 这里就不会再有人住了
Nobody would live here after that happened

968
01:04:00,937 --> 01:04:03,891
- 他们还会在这住吗？- 我记得在报纸上读到过这事
- Would they? - I remember reading it in the papers

969
01:04:04,273 --> 01:04:06,895
从迈阿密派出救援列车
A relief train was dispatched from Miami

970
01:04:07,318 --> 01:04:10,568
气压计降至最低
The barometer was down to about 26 inches

971
01:04:10,822 --> 01:04:13,739
那列火车驶入霍姆斯特德时
when that train pulled into Homestead

972
01:04:13,991 --> 01:04:18,036
工程师将一串空车厢推入危险区域
Engineer backed his string of empty coaches into the danger zone

973
01:04:18,287 --> 01:04:20,280
然后飓风来了
and the hurricane hit

974
01:04:20,957 --> 01:04:24,540
把那些火车直接撞出轨
Knocked those coaches right off the track

975
01:04:24,794 --> 01:04:28,708
风速达到了每小时两百英里
Two hundred miles an hour, that wind blew

976
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:34,590
12英尺高的潮汐穿过佛罗里达群岛
A tidal wave 1 2 feet high went right across the Key

整个城镇都被移平
Whole towns were wiped out

978
01:04:37,015 --> 01:04:39,969
数英里的轨道被掀起
Miles and miles of track were ripped up

979
01:04:40,226 --> 01:04:42,302
然后被冲走 什么都没有留下
and washed away. Nothing was left

980
01:04:42,937 --> 01:04:47,979
暴风雨过后 找到了500多具尸体
More than 500 bodies were recovered after the storm

981
01:04:48,568 --> 01:04:50,441
之后的几个月
And for months afterwards

982
01:04:50,695 --> 01:04:53,898
在红树林沼泽中发现了尸体
corpses were found in the mangrove swamps

983
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:01,243
你不喜欢它 是吗？暴风雨
You don't like it, do you? The storm

984
01:05:02,081 --> 01:05:03,741
拿出你的枪 为什么不呢
Show it your gun, why don't you

985
01:05:04,125 --> 01:05:05,453
如果它不停下来 就开枪打它
If it doesn't stop, shoot it

986
01:05:11,716 --> 01:05:13,839
所以公众投票反对禁酒令
So the public votes out Prohibition

987
01:05:14,135 --> 01:05:16,175
这就是暴徒的终结
And that's the end of the mobs

988
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:18,090
下次会有所不同
Next time, it'll be different

989
01:05:18,639 --> 01:05:20,798
我们吸取了教训 好吧
We learned our lesson, all right

990
01:05:21,059 --> 01:05:23,466
下一次 暴徒会团结在一起
Next time, the mobs'll get together

991
01:05:27,065 --> 01:05:28,475
掀起大浪
Make the big wave

992
01:05:28,733 --> 01:05:30,772
让它向我们冲来
Send it crashing down on us

如果需要 摧毁我们所有人 但要惩罚他
Destroy us all, if need be. But punish him

994
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:36,440
闭嘴 老头儿！我警告你！闭嘴
Shut up, old man! I'm warning you! Shut up

995
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:38,608

Hear me. Hear me

996
01:05:38,826 --> 01:05:40,024

01:06:55,028 --> 01:06:56,570
坦普尔先生
Mr.Temple

1001

坦普尔先生
Mr.Temple

1002
01:08:03,638 --> 01:08:05,927
暴风雨过去了
The storm's passing

1003
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:09,968
一两个破旧的窗户 海滩上有一些垃圾
A torn shutter or two, some trash on the beach

1004
01:08:10,228 --> 01:08:13,644
几个小时后 几乎没有什么可以提醒你发生过什么
In a few hours, there'll be little to remind you of what happened

1005
01:08:15,233 --> 01:08:17,521
我们还会再见到你吗 弗兰克
Will we ever see you again Frank

1006
01:08:17,777 --> 01:08:19,651
暴风雨
The storm

1007
01:08:20,113 --> 01:08:21,488
它正在离去
It's passing

1008
01:08:22,281 --> 01:08:24,903
- 我们还会见吗？- 希望如此
- Will we? - I hope so

1009
01:08:25,159 --> 01:08:27,199
你为什么不和我们一起呆在这里
Why don't you stay here with us

1010
01:08:27,453 --> 01:08:29,197
我们欢迎你
You're most welcome

继续 告诉他 诺拉

1017

我并不是要强迫你 孩子

我告诉他我会杀了他 他还是把船开走了
I told him I'd kill him. He did it just the same

There's another boat out there. It ain't much, but it'll get us to Cuba

01:09:42,278 --> 01:09:43,607
谁来驾驶它
Who's going to run it

坦普尔先生！你不是好人

你告诉过我 你把他们赶走了
You told me you sent them away

1043
01:10:10,807 --> 01:10:14,306
你骗了我 整个暴风雨期间 他们都在我门外
You lied to me. They were outside my door during the whole storm

1044
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:16,470
- 那又怎样？- 他们可能会死在那里
- So what? - They might've died out there

1045
01:10:16,729 --> 01:10:18,105

1046
01:10:18,356 --> 01:10:19,850
你这个肮脏的东西
You filth

1047
01:10:20,108 --> 01:10:22,859
他说的 你可以开船 这是真的
What he said, you can run a boat. That's a fact

1048
01:10:23,277 --> 01:10:25,270
他的初恋情人是一艘船

我不会带你去的
I won't take you

1052
01:10:33,996 --> 01:10:35,407
你宁愿死也不愿带我们
You'd rather die than take us

1053
01:10:35,665 --> 01:10:37,325
我没那么说
I didn't say that

1054
01:10:37,959 --> 01:10:40,794
你杀不了我 我是你逃脱这里的唯一机会
You won't kill me. I'm your only chance of getting away from here

1055
01:10:41,921 --> 01:10:44,957
还有其他方法可以让你就范 对吧 图茨
There's other ways of getting at you. Right, Toots

1056
01:10:45,258 --> 01:10:46,088
对
Right

1057
01:10:46,342 --> 01:10:49,129
- 也许我不会就范 - 你会的
- Maybe I'm up to them. - You wouldn't be

1058
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:53,546
和图茨相处几分钟后 你会开始问这样的问题
After a few minutes of Toots, you'll begin to ask questions like:

1059
01:10:53,808 --> 01:10:55,635
如果我之后变成跛子怎么办
What if I come out of this a cripple

1060
01:10:56,269 --> 01:11:00,682
我在乎他们逃跑吗
And "Do I care whether they make their getaway or don't?"

1061
01:11:00,940 --> 01:11:02,814
你所有的答案都是正确的
All your answers would be right ones

1062
01:11:03,067 --> 01:11:05,274
- 我不确定 - 我确定
- I'm not so sure. - I am

1063
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:07,978
当然 如果你急于知道
Of course, if you're anxious to find out

1064
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:11,442
你能忍受何种程度 我们会满足你的要求
just how good you are at taking it, we'll accommodate you

1065
01:11:11,659 --> 01:11:12,489
但我警告你
But I warn you

1066
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:14,911
图茨没有太多练习
Toots hasn't had much practice

1067
01:11:15,163 --> 01:11:16,906
有点生疏 可能会失手
Kind of rusty. Might slip

1068
01:11:17,290 --> 01:11:19,081
那太糟糕了
And that would be too bad

1069
01:11:19,584 --> 01:11:22,869
因为你在楼上说的很有道理
Because you made real sense upstairs when you said. .

多一个罗科 少一个罗科 不值得为之送命

One wrong word out of anybody and he gets it the same as Sawyer did

1074
01:11:46,194 --> 01:11:48,270
明白我的意思吗 老头儿
Understand me, old man

1075
01:11:52,408 --> 01:11:54,448
